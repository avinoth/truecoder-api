# truecoder-api

An API to get LOC written by a github user. Uses `/events/public` endpoint.

Need client id and client secret as parameters since github only allows for 60 requests per hour from an IP.

#### Things to do:-
* Find out the libraries used count.
* Filter out the LOCs of libraries / plugins.
